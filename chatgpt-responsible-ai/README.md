# Using ChatGPT to build a (responsible) classification model

## Summary of Learnings / Takeaways

This is a really great (and well documented!) package [AI Fairness 360](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360)

I think I'm going to start having the AI generate this boilerplate ML pipeline code whenever possible (and I 100% don't trust it with anything company proprietary) - it did a nice job constructing the scikit-learn pipeline-style code (and at time of writing this, I have yet to test that out and make sure it works)

As someone that's not a PhD in ML, it's SUPER nice to be able to abstract away some of this knowledge...I think I know what to ask, but it's so intimidating to approach these things, and they seem too complex, so I assume not to use them.  Big benefit of creating tooling is that it can reduce "activation energy" of good practices, which leads to higher adoption (obvious statement, but calling it out)

Also, whoever is reading this, I'd love to have your feedback on aif360...are there better alternatives?  I might not know what I don't know in this space.

## Entire conversation

Conversation details saved in [chatgpt_conversation](chatgpt_conversation.md) - here's how I grabbed it:

1. Have conversation with ChatGPT
2. Export conversation to text via Chrome extension [Export ChatGPT Convesation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-chatgpt-conversati/clgidpflecgaaabfcmdmkcgebpbadgoc?hl=en-US) by [jamesniranye@gmail.com](mailto:jamesniranye@gmail.com) --> saved in [chatgpt_conversation.md](chatgpt_conversation.md)
3. Reformat so it generally mirrors how it looks in ChatGPT (wonder if there's a better extension for this? e.g. markdown tables)
